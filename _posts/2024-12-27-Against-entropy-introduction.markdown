While entropy is a fundamental concept in information theory (where [Shannon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entropy_(information_theory)) pioneered its use to measure uncertainty in data transmission), it first emerged in thermodynamics as a way to understand the universal tendency of physical systems to move toward increasing disorder and equilibrium. On a more philosophical level, I like to think of entropy as the idea that constant energy has to be put into a system to maintain or improve it, else the inevitable force of entropy will break it down to return to an equilibrium. Beyond the scientific realm, this concept is a powerful metaphor for understanding progress and maintenance in all aspects of life: any system (physical, intellectual or social) requires constant energy input to maintain and improve, or it will inevitably break down toward its natural equilibrium state.

Jordan B. Peterson captures this universal truth eloquently:
> "If you stand still you fall backwards,
> You cannot stand still, because the world moves away from you if you stand still.
> And there is no stasis. Only backwards
> - Jordan B. Peterson"

As a runner, I've experienced how achieving a certain level of aerobic capacity doesn't guarantee its permanence. After periods of inactivity (with the exception of rest days) hard-earned endurance begins to slip away. Our muscles, left unused lose strength and the same principles apply to our mental capabilities.  This idea of constant maintenance and growth extends to virtually every meaningful aspect of our lives. 

I have to admit that confronting this truth can be unsettling. It challenges the comforting notion that a plateau can be reached and one can simply coast based on our past experiences. It can even bring up a hint of slight nihilism: why invest energy when entropy is inevitable? 

Yet its inevitability is precisely what makes our efforts more meaningful. There are many aspects of life where entropy's march is beyond our control - aging, illness, random misfortune - this makes our chosen battles against entropy all the more significant. In those chosen areas where we can exert influence, our persistent effort becomes a monument of human agency against the tendency of chaos. 

This blog (Against Entropy) is my attempt to create "local pockets of order" in an increasingly chaotic world. In our age of rapid-fire content consumption, building lasting, interconnected understanding remains vital. Through these writings, I aim to develop a more entropy-resistant grasp of the ideas that fascinate me.
